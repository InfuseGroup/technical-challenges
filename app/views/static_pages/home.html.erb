<%# This is the link to the first challenge -> challenge_1_path %>
<%= react_component 'staticPages/Home', linkPath: challenge_1_path %>

<%# routes file tells me that this is the root page. It displays the Home component
which takes the linkPath param, which was set to nil, but you kindly give the answer.
So not much to say here.%>
